Description

The objective of this lab is to build a Morse code transmitter. It must take a single digit (0-9) as argument from the serial port and blink out that number in Morse code using an LED.

To start, make sure you install the Arduino software, available via http://arduino.cc/. For this lab, you will need:
Serial communication to the Arduino. This uses the same cable we used to program the board. Check out http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Serial and several examples in the Arduino IDE to get started.
A blinking LED. Should be all set here after your in-class work.
Morse code for the digits. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code
For this lab you do not have to build any circuit.


What to Submit

You should submit:
Documentation
Code and any supporting resources
Also, remember you will have to demonstrate your implementation to either Rajit or Sean.

The lab documentation should include:
Executive summary - what did you do, in 30 seconds or less
System-level block diagram - capture both the hardware and software components of your system at a high level
Software description - highlight the most important and interesting parts and how they work. We do not want to hear about every line or even every function, we have your (well-commented) code for that.
List of references - annotated with what you took from each
As long as it includes these elements, your lab documentation can take whatever form you like - traditional report document, Instructables-like tutorial, three act play - it's up to you.
Please submit your lab materials (documentation, code) via Blackboard assignment. If you need to make other arrangements just let us know.
